<p> The materials here represent the output from a set of softwares developed for the investigation of the OSKM reprogramming process. </p>

<p>Several outputs utilize 1 dimensional visualization of axies including euclidean interpritations of the data. </p>

<p>These interpritations included the use of distance from the start or end points (skin cells (bjs)) and stem cells (hesc). </p>

<p>The third single dimensional perpective is the progression of a sample along a sraight line 96 dimensional trajectory from the center of the know starter and known destination cells. </p>
